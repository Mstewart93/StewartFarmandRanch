        <h1>Stewart Farm and Ranch</output></h1>

        <p>Stewart Farm and Ranch started as a small family farm in rural Utah. We got our start in Hay, Grain, and Corn crops. Soon we made
            the choice to branch out into raising chickents for eggs.
        </p>
        <p>After a few months of research we settled on Rhode Island Reds for our farm. We chose them for their versitility, in particular their
            egg laying abilities. In the beginning we raised our chickens for eggs only. After about 2 years of keeping our chickens for eggs only we 
        decided to breed, and butcher our chickens. The decision was based on a few things.</p>
        <h4>1. A hens optimal egg laying is within the first couple of years.</h4>
        <h4>2. MeLyssa did not come from a farming background. The idea of butvhering their own animals was a hard idea
            to wrap her head around. However, she realized one day that if she was going to eat meat anyway, knowing where the meat came from 
            and how the animal was treated was absolutley critical for her. 
        </h4>
        <h4> 3. From a cost to outcome standpoint, breeding your own chickens for eggs and butchers enables you to see the entire 
            process and get more for your money per bird. 
        </h4>

        <p>Despite the research their is a big difference between what you read in the books and what happens in real life. It took the first 
            3 years of the opperation before we were able to find a system that worked well both for us as well as our animals. Now we are able 
            to breed, and raise out birds successfully.
        </p>

        <!--Insert a Picture of the chickens here or at top, then add the pigs to our about. Include pictures of the farm as well and such. -->

        <p> The Next animal that we set our eyes on were the pigs. We did about 2 years worth of research before we got our first 2 pigs. </p>
        


        Welcome

        Hello! My name is Lilly Figueroa. I am the owner of Colorado Kunes and Cows and the fifth generation to live and work on our centennial ranch in north Mancos. Mancos is located in a small valley in southwest Colorado. 
        
        I am eighteen and a Senior at Mancos High School. I began Colorado Kunes and Cows a few years ago with a passion for agriculture and a growing interest in business. My business began with three pigs shipped from Virginia and three beef steers. Since then, the operations have doubled. Of course, I would not be where I am without the constant support of my family. We now have four breeding sows, two boars, an upcoming gilt, and a barrow. I am also raising six steers a year that are sold to local buyers in Mancos, Durango, Hesperus, Dove Creek, and Pagosa as well as the Mancos School District. The money that I earn from my animals will help me pay for college and the path to my career.

        We are the Carlisle Family; David, Amanda, Grace, Mason, & Audrey. We purchased this North Florida 1970â€™s Fixer Upper in 2018 with about 5 acres with hopes to create a home. Not just any home, but one where we would put our roots down and thrive.

This family has always had a love for nature, animals, and everything in between. Our new homestead, Carlisle Acres, has given us the space to grow our family with animals, try our hand at gardening, and take on more projects than we can handle.

Follow us on our journey while we learn how to homestead and share beautiful images of our animals, life, our successes, and failures.

Amanda is not new to blogging. She runs AFewShortcuts.com & MomsWithCrockpots.com. Grace is also entrepreneurial and has her own small business GracefullyOriginal.com where she makes and sells the most beautiful acrylic paintings.
