        <h1>Stewart Farm and Ranch</output></h1>

        <p>Stewart Farm and Ranch started as a small family farm in rural Utah. We got our start in Hay, Grain, and Corn crops. Soon we made
            the choice to branch out into raising chickents for eggs.
        </p>
        <p>After a few months of research we settled on Rhode Island Reds for our farm. We chose them for their versitility, in particular their
            egg laying abilities. In the beginning we raised our chickens for eggs only. After about 2 years of keeping our chickens for eggs only we 
        decided to breed, and butcher our chickens. The decision was based on a few things.</p>
        <h4>1. A hens optimal egg laying is within the first couple of years.</h4>
        <h4>2. MeLyssa did not come from a farming background. The idea of butvhering their own animals was a hard idea
            to wrap her head around. However, she realized one day that if she was going to eat meat anyway, knowing where the meat came from 
            and how the animal was treated was absolutley critical for her. 
        </h4>
        <h4> 3. From a cost to outcome standpoint, breeding your own chickens for eggs and butchers enables you to see the entire 
            process and get more for your money per bird. 
        </h4>

        <p>Despite the research their is a big difference between what you read in the books and what happens in real life. It took the first 
            3 years of the opperation before we were able to find a system that worked well both for us as well as our animals. Now we are able 
            to breed, and raise out birds successfully.
        </p>
        <p> The Next animal that we set our eyes on were the pigs. We did about a years worth of research before we got our first 2 pigs. </p>
